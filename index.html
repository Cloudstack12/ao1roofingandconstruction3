                    <p><b>Regular Roof Maintenance Tips</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Your roof's health depends on how well you take care of it. By performing regular maintenance, you can detect potential problems early and prevent costly repairs down the road. Here are some roof maintenance tips to follow before an emergency arises:</p>
                    <section>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Inspect Your Roof Regularly:</b> Conduct a visual inspection of your roof at least twice a year. Check for any damage or signs of wear and tear, such as cracked or missing shingles, rusted flashing, or deteriorated sealants.</li>

                            <li><b>Keep Your Gutters Clean:</b> Clogged gutters can cause water to back onto your roof, leading to leaks and water damage. Clean your gutters at least twice yearly, especially after storms or heavy rainfall.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li><b>Trim Overhanging Trees:</b> Overhanging tree branches can damage your roof and lead to debris buildup. Trim any branches that are too close to your roof.</li>
